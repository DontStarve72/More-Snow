# More Snow

Adds more snow to BTA. 
Inspired by [Snow! Real Magic!](https://github.com/Snownee/SnowRealMagic/tree/1.20-fabric) and the snow behavior in [TerraFirmaCraft](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft)

### Snow can now:
- Occupy the same block as foliage 
- Accurately land on top of partial blocks such as stairs (TODO) and slabs (Partially Implemented)
- Land on and around fences (TODO)
- Propagate under (or optionally always fall through (TODO)) leaves

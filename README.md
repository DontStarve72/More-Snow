# More Snow

Adds more snow to BTA. 
Inspired by ([Snow! Real Magic!]https://github.com/Snownee/SnowRealMagic/tree/1.20-fabric) and the snow behavior in ([TerraFirmaCraft]https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft)

### Snow can now:
- Occupy the same block as foliage 
- Accurately land on top of partial blocks such as stairs and slaps
- Land on and around fences
- Propagate under (or optionally always fall through) leaves
